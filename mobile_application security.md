		* Is the user still using the same device?
	* Geolocation
		* Has the user’s location changed significantly?

		* Bind an application to a phone (don’t run if in another context like a debugger)
	* Secure storage
		* Using hardware secure element
	* Secure channel
		* Step up from HTTPS, prevent against MITM (even rogue towers)
	* E-signatures
	* Behavioral authentication
		* Biometric data — touch pressure, common typos
	* Facial authentication
	* Fingerprint authentication — normalized API across platforms
	* Risk-based authentication — real-time analysis on backend
	* CRONTO authentication — QR code locked to a specific user/device
	* QR code support
	* Transaction authentication — prove user intent
	* Push notification
