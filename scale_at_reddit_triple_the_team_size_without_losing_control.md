# Scale at Reddit: Triple the Team Size Without Losing Control
## Reddit Stats
* 350M+ monthly users
* 4th largest site in the US
* What’s new?
	* Grew from 40 to 130 engineers in a year
* Within 3 years, 92% of startups fail (43% due to issues with scale)
## First week at Reddit
* 30+ person standups
* Google Slide tracking tools
* Lots of tech leads but no engineering managers
* Slow pace
* Urgent work to do
## Roles + Responsibilities
* As company grows, roles get more specialized (people wear many hats at smaller startups)
* RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
	* Advantages
		* Clear ownership outcomes
	* Disadvantages
	* Inflexibility
	* Does not directly address **lack of trust**
* Program vs product vs engineering managers
* PM
	* Customer (who)
	* Vision (what)
	* Strategy (why)
* Engineering manager
	* Engineers (who)
	* Architecture (how)
	* Execution (when)
## Finding managers and removing tech leads
* What do you are about more, people or architecture?
* What are your thoughts on shipping towards a deadline?
* Your PM goes to 2 of your direct reports and tells them to immediately start working on a feature what do you do?
* You spend one full day a week fishing LinkedIn or working with recruiting, how do you feel?
* Splits Engineering managers from Architects
## Trust (but verify) — Building Trust
* Pilot teams to show quick wins
* Leadership off sites and trust falls
* Scale pressure and complexity forces delegation
## Results
* 0 tech leads
* 10 architects
* 10 PMs
* 20 managers/directors
## Engineering at scale, what gets harder?
* Awareness — everyone wants to know what everyone else is doing
* Coordination — Here comes process: managers, tools, meetings
* Bottlenecks — missed dependencies can cripple your production roadmap
## Why?
* For every 1 engineer you hire, add to backlog 1.1 engineers worth of work
* Eventually coordination costs and scope overcome your ability to deliver reliably
* You’ll eventually need process change or reorganize
## Process advice and caution
* Avoid process junkies and boilerplate solutions — evolve something that works for your team
* Some variants of Agile promote intra-team coordination more than actually shipping code
* Original Toyota kanban “kaizen” — minimal processes created from the bottom up
* Process becomes culture over time
## Reddit’s Jira evolution
* Definition
* Planning
* Staffing
* Execution
* Launch
* Monitor
## Team Dashboards
* Good to see all the work, but switch to kanban boards for daily standups
* Report up with Jira and Tableau — great for directors team but too much detail for execs and company-wide communications
* Executive dashboards
## Urgency
* Bad
	* Artificial top-down deadlines
	* Working late hours
* Worse
	* No deadlines at all
* Good
	* Meaningful work tied to clear user benefit or company benefit
	* Disciplined use of time
	* Tough but achievable deadlines set and re-enforced within the team
* The best kind of urgency is discipline in disguise
## Results
* More productive without extra headcount
