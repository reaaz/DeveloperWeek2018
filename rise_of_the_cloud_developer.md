# Rise of the Cloud Developer
## New Application Development Demands
* Serverless
* Chatbots
* Blockchains
* Machine Learning
* DevOps
* Open source
## Demo: Buying and Selling a car
## Bots
* The mobile transformation — the post-app era begins
* VPAs take over app tasks and interactions
* Problems of scale for the IoT, physical web
* Conversational AI-first will replace cloud-first and mobile-first
### Challenges
* Diversity of channel interfaces (chat, web, text voice, apps, devices)
* Implementation Complexity — access, security, back end integration, dialog design, languages
* Getting AI Right — NLP, ML, speech, image, sentiment, plus dialog and context
## Serverless
* `fn` is an open source function as a service solution from Oracle
* Why server less?
	* Easier: just think about code not infrastrucutre
	* Powerful: Transparent and limitless scaling
	* Faster: Deploy faster
	* Cheaper: since you never pay for idle time
### The Fn Project
* Containers are primitives
* Open source serverless compute platform
* Can be deployed to any cloud or on-premise
### Fn function
* Input via stdin
* Output via stdout
* Log stderr 
### Fn Flow
* Build long-running, reliable, scalable functions with rich sets of language specific primitives
* Supports complex parallel processes that are readable and testable with standard programming tools
## Why Blockchain?
* Distributed ledger with tamper-evident chain of blocks
* Smart contracts providing automation and handling events
* Real-time updates when nodes reach consesus
* Non-repudiation based on digitally signed transactions
* Confidentiality using private channels
## Blockchain challenges
* No plug and play for enterprise
* Insufficient production readiness
* Continuous platform evolution
* Operational challenges
