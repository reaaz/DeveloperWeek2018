## PDF is an Open File Format
* Many tools available that implement the PDF specification
* Different PDF implementations can cause problems, so many choose to:
	* Only implement parts of the PDF spec
	* Have PDF features that are incomplete or incorrect
	* Add proprietary extensions and features to the PDFs that are generated
	* Use PDFs that might be outdated — first PDF spec was published in 1993
## Differences in how documents are viewed
* Implementations discard key information
* Documents can be misinterpreted
* Missing content (like comments or transparency)
## Difficulties in extracting text
* Some implementations lack structured content
* Text might not be represented with glyphs
* Text extraction tools often must re-create content flow
* This means extracting text in some instances is extremely difficult if not virtually impossible
	* Results in a lot of AI/ML to extract content
* PDFs can often be large
* Transparency rendering can slow down printing
* Large scale operations require lots of processing power
