## PDF is an Open File Format
	* Many tools available that implement the PDF specification
	* Different PDF implementations can cause problems, so many choose to:
		* Only implement parts of the PDF spec
		* Have PDF features that are incomplete or incorrect
		* Add proprietary extensions and features to the PDFs that are generated
		* Use PDFs that might be outdated — first PDF spec was published in 1993
## Differences in how documents are viewed
	* Implementations discard key information
	* Documents can be misinterpreted
	* Missing content (like comments or transparency)
## Difficulties in extracting text
	* Some implementations lack structured content
	* Text might not be represented with glyphs
	* Text extraction tools often must re-create content flow
	* This means extracting text in some instances is extremely difficult if not virtually impossible
		* Results in a lot of AI/ML to extract content
	* PDFs can often be large
	* Transparency rendering can slow down printing
	* Large scale operations require lots of processing power
